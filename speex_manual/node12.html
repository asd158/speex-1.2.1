Vorbis is open-source and patent-free;
why do we need Speex?
</H2>

<P>
Vorbis is a great project but its goals are not the same as Speex.
Vorbis is mostly aimed at compressing music and audio in general,
while Speex targets speech only. For that reason Speex can achieve
much better results than Vorbis on speech, typically 2-4 times higher
compression at equal quality.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001202000000000000000">
Isn't there an open-source implementation of the GSM-FR codec? Why
is Speex necessary?</A>
</H2>

<P>
First of all, it's not clear whether GSM-FR is covered by a Philips
patent (see http://kbs.cs.tu-berlin.de/~jutta/toast.html).
Also, GSM-FR offers mediocre quality at a relatively high bit-rate,
while Speex can offer equivalent quality at almost half the bit-rate.
Last but not least, Speex offers a wide range of bit-rates and sampling
rates, while GSM-FR is limited to 8 kHz speech at 13 kbps.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001203000000000000000">
Under what license is Speex released?</A>
</H2>

<P>
As of version 1.0 beta 1, Speex is released under Xiph's version of
the (revised) BSD license (see Appendix <A HREF="node15.html#sec:Speex-License">D</A>).
This license is one of the most permissive open-source licenses.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001204000000000000000">
Am I allowed to use Speex in commercial software?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Yes. As long as you comply with the license. This basically means
you have to keep the copyright notice and you can't use our name to
promote your product without authorization. For more details, see
license in Appendix <A HREF="node15.html#sec:Speex-License">D</A>.

Ogg, Speex, Vorbis, what's the difference?
</H2>

<P>
Ogg is a container format for holding multimedia data. Vorbis is an
audio codec that uses Ogg to store its bit-streams as files, hence
the name Ogg Vorbis. Speex also uses the Ogg format to store its bit-streams
as files, so technically they would be ``Ogg Speex'' files (I
prefer to call them just Speex files). One difference with Vorbis
however, is that Speex is less tied with Ogg. Actually, if you just
do Voice over IP (VoIP), you don't need Ogg at all.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001206000000000000000">
What's the extension for Speex?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Speex files have the .spx extension. Note, however that the Speex
tools (speexenc, speexdec) do not rely on the extension at all, so
any extension will work.

<P>

Can I use Speex for compressing music?
</H2>

<P>
Just like Vorbis is not really adapted to speech, Speex is really
not adapted for music. In most cases, you'll be better of with Vorbis
when it comes to music.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001208000000000000000">
I converted some MP3s to Speex and the quality is bad. What's wrong?</A>
</H2>

<P>
This is called transcoding and it will always result in much poorer
quality than the original MP3. Unless you have a really good (size)
reason to do so, never transcode speech. This is even valid for self
transcoding (tandeming), i.e. If you decode a Speex file and re-encode
it again at the same bit-rate, you will lose quality.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION001209000000000000000">
Does Speex run on Windows?</A>
</H2>

<P>
Compilation on Windows has been supported since version 0.8.0. There
are also several front-ends available from the website.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012010000000000000000">
Why is encoding so slow compared to decoding?</A>
</H2>

<P>
For most kinds of compression, encoding is inherently slower than
decoding. In the case of Speex, encoding consists of finding, for
each vector of 5 to 10 samples, the entry that matches the best within
a codebook consisting of 16 to 256 entries. On the other hand, at
decoding all that needs to be done is look up the right entry in the
codebook using the encoded index. Since a lookup is much faster than
a search, the decoder works much faster than the encoder.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012011000000000000000">
Why is Speex so slow on my iPaq (or insert any platform without an
FPU)?</A>
</H2>

<P>
You probably didn't build Speex with the fixed-point option (-enable-fixed-point).
Even if you did, not all modes have been ported to use fixed-point
arithmetic, so the code may be slowed down by a few float operations
left (e.g. in the wideband mode).

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012012000000000000000">
I'm getting unusual background noise (hiss) when using libspeex in
my application. How do I fix that?</A>
</H2>

<P>
One of the causes could be scaling of the input speech. Speex expects
signals to have a <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ \pm2^{15}$"></SPAN>
 (signed short) dynamic range. If the
dynamic range of your signals is too small (e.g. <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img72.png"
 ALT="$ \pm1.0$"></SPAN>
), you will
suffer important quantization noise. A good target is to have a dynamic
range around <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="49" HEIGHT="31" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img73.png"
 ALT="$ \pm8000$"></SPAN>
 which is large enough, but small enough to
make sure there's no clipping when converting back to signed short.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012013000000000000000">
I get very distorted speech when using libspeex in my application.
What's wrong?</A>
</H2>

<P>
There are many possible causes for that. One of them is errors in
the way the bits are manipulated. Another possible cause is the use
of the same encoder or decoder state for more than one audio stream
(channel), which produces strange effects with the filter memories.
If the input speech has an amplitude close to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><IMG
 WIDTH="37" HEIGHT="36" ALIGN="MIDDLE" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img71.png"
 ALT="$ \pm2^{15}$"></SPAN>
, it is
possible that at decoding, the amplitude be a bit higher than that,
causing clipping when saving as 16-bit PCM.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012014000000000000000">
How does Speex compare to other proprietary codecs?</A>
</H2>

<P>
It's hard to give precise figures since no formal listening tests
have been performed yet. All I can say is that in terms of quality,
Speex competes on the same ground as other proprietary codecs (not
necessarily the best, but not the worst either). Speex also has many
features that are not present in most other codecs. These include
variable bit-rate (VBR), integration of narrowband and wideband, as
well as stereo support. Of course, another area where Speex is really
hard to beat is the quality/price ratio. Unlike many very expensive
codecs, Speex is free and anyone may distribute or modify it at will.

<P>

Can Speex pass DTMF?
</H2>

<P>
I guess it all depends on the bit-rate used. Though no formal testing
has yet been performed, I'd say is correctly at 8 kbps and above.
Also, make sure you don't use the lowest complexity (see SPEEX_SET_COMPLEXITY
or -comp option), as it causes significant noise.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012016000000000000000">
Can Speex pass V.9x modem signals correctly?</A>
</H2>

<P>
If I could do that I'd be very rich by now :-) Seriously, that would
break fundamental laws of information theory.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012017000000000000000">
What is your (Jean-Marc) relationship with the University of Sherbrooke
and how does Speex fit into that?</A>
</H2>

<P>
I have completed my <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Ph.D.</SPAN> at the University of Sherbrooke in
2005 in mobile robotics. Although I did my master with the Sherbrooke
speech coding group (in speech enhancement, not coding), was no longer
associated with them when developing Speex. It should <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">not</SPAN>
be understood that they or the University of Sherbrooke have anything
to do with the Speex project. Furthermore, Speex does not make use
of any code or proprietary technology developed in the Sherbrooke
speech coding group. 

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION0012018000000000000000"></A><A NAME="780"></A>

CELP, ACELP, what's the difference?
</H2>

<P>
CELP stands for ``Code Excited Linear Prediction'', while ACELP
stands for ``<SPAN  CLASS="textit">Algebraic</SPAN> Code Excited Linear Prediction''.
That means ACELP is a CELP technique that uses an algebraic codebook
represented as a sum of unit pulses, thus making the codebook search
much more efficient. This technique was invented at the University
of Sherbrooke and is now one of the most widely used form of CELP.
Unfortunately, since it is patented, it cannot be used in Speex.
